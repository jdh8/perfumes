Chen-Pang He (jdh8)'s perfume formulas
======================================
I am a novice who got some common sense from my ex.  I name my formulas after
programming languages I like.

Concentrations are in %v/v.  I use [MERU perfume base][base] over the counter,
which contains ethanol, distilled water, and an emulsifier.  Essential oils are
from Florihana, which are organic and GC/MS tested.

[base]: https://www.meru.com.tw/product.php?pid_for_show=3521

- **Fortran**: Sweet orange 7.5%, lavender vera 5.0%, cedarwood atlas 2.5%
- **Lisp**: Jasmine sambac 5.0%, ? 5.0%

Naming plans
------------
1. Try to follow historical chronology
2. Indole-rich perfumes are named after functional programming languages for
   their mixed reputation.  (I am a fan of both.)
3. Footgun programming languages (e.g. C++, JavaScript, PHP) indicate
   perfumes with photosensitizing ingredients, usually citrus oils.
